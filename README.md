# ALXJRON Neovim Configuration

This is my common configuration setup for neovim to use as an IDE/text editor. 

### Plugins include:
- lsp zero + mason + cmp
- Gruvbox
- And Markdown Preview

### To install:
Run the bash script `add-to-config.sh` and it will copy the contents
of nvim to ~/.config  
Plugins will be downloaded automatically if they are not present.
